# NEETCODE COURSES
This repo follows guidelines from [neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/).
For now I'm using TypeScript, as backend web developement is my end goal (and variables without types scare me).

The solutions provided may not be an original implementation.
This is for reference only, simply to store and reflect on in time.
